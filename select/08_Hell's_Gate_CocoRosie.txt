From the cracking of the whip
Nanny worked down at the shop
Lifting hell's gate, she lifted hell's gate
From the cracking of the whip
Pappy worked down at the shipyard
Jail mate, jail mate

Toss a penny to the sky
Heads or tails, who knows, not I
False alarm, narrow escape
Nearly got my cousin raped
Hell's gate
Feathers ruffle hell's gate

Shoot the cat, shoot the crow
Empty pocket seed to sew
Daddy wore his baggies low
Stinky long john

From the cracking of the whip
Nanny worked down at the shop
Lifting hell's gate, she lifted hell's gate
From the cracking of the whip
Pappy worked down at the shipyard
Jail mate, jail mate

Shoot the cat, shoot the crow
Toss a penny, make it grow
Take the shine off
Take the shine off

Toss a penny to the sky
Heads or tails, who knows, not I
Time to pass on in them chips
If the shoe never fit
Toss a penny to the sky
Heads or tails to live or die
Time to pass on in your chips
If you've given your last wish

My momma taught me how to pray
I didn't know who to blame or who to thank
I see her face in the clouds
Pick a feather from the ground
Try to make my momma proud
What would she say to you?

Shoot the cat, shoot the crow
Toss a penny, make it grow
Take the shine off
Take the shine off

From the cracking of the whip
Pappy worked down at the shipyard
Jail mate, jail mate

Toss a penny to the sky
Heads or tails, who knows, not I
Time to pass on in them chips
If the shoe never fits
Toss a penny to the sky
Heads or tails, to live or die
Time to pass on in your chips
If you've given your last wish
Time to pass on in your chips
If you've given your last wish
